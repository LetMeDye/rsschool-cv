## About me and my aspirations

My name is Asset, and I aspire to be a good programmer. My main goals are to write the cleanest code, so it shines, create products with the greatest User Experience. I am currently working as a Junior Web Developer, in "Cubeware, LLC". I do coding for fun, mainly do exercizes on HackerRank.

## My stack:

> HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery
> dotNet, mainly C#
> MSSQL, EntityFramework
> Python (mainly for helping my freshmen friends with ICT)

## Code Example from CodeWars:

```Javascript
function factorial(n){
  if(n<0) return -1;
  if(n ==0 || n==1)
    return 1;
  return n*factorial(n-1);
}
```
